The emphasis is on computer-aided numerical analysis rather than numerical simulation. This course is suitable for scientists and engineers with a practical interest in nonlinear phenomena. Topics include computational aspects of: homotopy and continuation methods, fixed points and stationary solutions, asymptotic stability, bifurcations, periodic solutions, transition to chaos, conservative systems, travelling wave solutions, discretization techniques. A variety of applications will be considered. Numerical software packages will be available. A project."
